Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
Web Service Instance - C3 EC2 instances should not have a public IPv4 address
CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-Region trail that includes read and write management events
VPC Security Groups allow all ingress and egress traffic which violates the AWS recommendation.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
Restrict the IP range that can access the application server on port 22.
Disable public ip ec2 and connect to ALB
Limit the traffic on the Security Groups only allow 80 and 443 as well as reference the other security group for accessing AWS resource within VPC.
