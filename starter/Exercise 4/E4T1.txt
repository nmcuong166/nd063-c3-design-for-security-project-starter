# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
 Disable password login on the application server
 Restrict network traffic that can reach the application server
Retrict permission IAM role to S3 bucket

Enable server-side encryption on the S3 buckets
limit instances profile role that can access buckets
